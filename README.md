# Simon
It is another homework during my earlier coding time while studying from freeCodeCamp. 

I did it on CodePen.io with JQuery. 

## How to play
- [Basic rule (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
- You can select normal mode or crazy mode to play the game. 
- In normal mode you are allowed for unlimited attempts til you hit the buttons correctly, while in crazy mode you only have one chance.

- I tried hard to save them but not working after all, so I had to turn them off
- It was very sad
